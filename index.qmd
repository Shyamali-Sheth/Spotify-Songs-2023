As a singer-songwriter with a passion for music, I've always been fascinated by what makes a song resonate with listeners. Today, I'd like to explore this topic by analyzing data from the most streamed songs on Spotify in 2023 by examining various musical elements, such as the lyrics' speechiness, the tempo (BPM), and the key in which the songs are composed. We can uncover patterns and trends that contribute to a song's popularity.

data <- read_csv("data/spotify-2023.csv")
data <- data %>%
  rename(artist_name = `artist(s)_name`)

track_counts <- data %>%
  count(artist_name)
```
